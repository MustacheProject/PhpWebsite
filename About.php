        <time>2013</time> I've always had passion for cooking but here I decide
        to spend time and money on a professional chef course! It required me
        to sacrifice a huge part of my free time, especially when I finish the course
        and start working in kitchen, because I was helding both my jobs.
        Office worker in suite in the morning, Chef with uniform in the night!
        (I actually do not know how I survived!)

        <time>2016/2017</time> After one year in Australia working as Chef,
        I felt like was time for me to go back to my REAL and first passion, programming.
        I completed a Diploma of Software Development and an Advance Diploma of IT
         in order to get back all the knowlege I had and learn even more of them.
